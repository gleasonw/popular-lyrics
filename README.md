# Music's most popular words
Carleton College, CS 257 Software Design, Winter 2020

Authors: Jack Rybarczyk, Will Gleason, Zev Buffet-Davis

A website to analyze the lyrics of popular songs, limited to the top 100 Billboard charts from 1964-2015. The website and database were hosted through Carleton College and are not currently available publicly.
All credit on lyrical data goes toÂ https://github.com/walkerkq/musiclyrics 


The website is a search tool, in which one can input 3 types of queries:

1. Word. Querying a word will show a Google Trends-like usage chart and rank songs by usage of your word.

2. Year or Year Range. Querying a year or year range will show the top words of the year [range], and a wordcloud. Typing a year will also show that year's billboard chart.

3. Artist. Querying an artist (indicated by checking the artist box) will bring a results page showing their most used words and a wordcloud.
